            <img src="images/about-us.jpg" alt="Alice Johnson" class="about-image">
            <p>Cozy Corner Cafe was founded by Alice Johnson in the heart of Charlotte, NC. Alice's vision was to create a welcoming space where the community could come together to enjoy high-quality coffee, delicious treats, and a warm, inviting atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Driven by a passion for great coffee and a love for her community, Alice carefully sources the finest beans and works with local bakers to offer a delightful menu. Our goal is to be more than just a cafe â€“ we want to be your cozy corner away from home.</p>
